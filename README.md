Transforming Bengaluru’s Traffic with Data-Driven Insights

We have developed an innovative traffic analysis and visualization solution for Bengaluru to tackle the city’s notorious congestion issues. Leveraging open-source datasets and integrating them with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), our project provides a detailed spatial representation of how urban infrastructure and physical geography influence traffic dynamics.

What We Developed
Our comprehensive analysis of Bengaluru’s traffic patterns includes:

Dynamic Data Visualizations: Showcasing traffic volume trends and congestion levels across different areas.
Spatial Congestion Mapping: Highlighting the most congested zones in Bengaluru.
Environmental Impact Analysis: Examining how weather and geographic features like road networks and green spaces affect traffic flow.
Key Benefits
Our project delivers actionable, data-driven insights to:

City Planners and Traffic Authorities: Informing infrastructure improvements and policy changes to alleviate congestion.
Residents: Enhancing daily life by reducing commute times and improving air quality.
By offering a holistic view of Bengaluru’s traffic issues through advanced data and geographic analysis, our solution contributes to a more sustainable and livable city.
